HEAD TRACKING MOUSE CONTROL
====================================

This script uses your webcam and MediaPipe's Face Mesh to estimate your head pose and control the mouse cursor using head orientation.

The webcam used for tracking can be found here ($35): https://amzn.to/43of401

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI
- Keyboard

To install the required packages:
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyautogui keyboard

USAGE
-----
1. Ensure a webcam is connected. The script defaults to camera index 1. Change to 0 if needed.
2. Run the script:
    python MonitorTracking.py
3. Two windows will appear:
    - "Head-Aligned Cube": shows your face with overlayed bounding box and tracking vector.
    - "Facial Landmarks": shows the detected facial landmarks.

FEATURES
--------
- Real-time head pose estimation.
- Virtual wireframe cube aligned to your head orientation.
- Mouse control mapped to yaw and pitch angle from your face.
- Press F7 to toggle mouse control on/off.
- Press 'c' to calibrate when looking straight at your monitor center.
- Press 'q' to quit the application.

NOTES
-----
- Calibration centers the screen mapping to your current head pose.
- The program calculates yaw and pitch from the forward-facing vector derived from facial landmarks.
- Movement is smoothed using a running average of recent pose estimates.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If tracking is jittery, increase the `filter_length` value.
- If the wrong camera is used, change `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` to another index.
